Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm UÄŸur! Iâ€™m currently focused on building my skills in React for frontend development, delving into component lifecycle, state management, and hooks. Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on projects related to web development and UI/UX design, and I'm looking for help with optimizing performance in React applications. Feel free to ask me about JavaScript, React, or my favorite coding resources! You can reach me @UgurBoss on Twitter. My pronouns are he/him, and a fun fact about me is that I love exploring new coffee shops while coding!
